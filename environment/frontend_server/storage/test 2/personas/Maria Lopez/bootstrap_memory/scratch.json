      "Based on the information provided, it seems that there might be some confusion or errors in Maria's schedule. It appears that she has a busy day planned, with most of her time dedicated to studying for her physics degree and streaming games on Twitch. However, there are some discrepancies in her schedule that need to be addressed.\n\nThe original schedule had Maria spending 3 hours streaming games from 3:00 pm to 6:00 pm, but it seems that she did not spend that amount of time streaming as planned. To fix this, you can adjust her schedule and have her spend more time streaming each day. Additionally, it is important to ensure that Maria is meeting her daily plan requirement of spending at least 3 hours a day streaming or gaming.\n\nIt would also be helpful to have more context or information about what was supposed to happen during those hours in order to make any necessary adjustments or corrections to Maria's schedule. It is not clear whether the 3 hours of streaming were meant to be consecutive or if they could include breaks for other activities such as going to the gym or spending time with friends.\n\nOverall, it seems that Maria has a productive and balanced schedule for Monday, February 13th. With some adjustments to ensure she is meeting her daily plan requirement and some additional context about what was supposed to happen during those hours, her schedule can be further optimized to help her achieve her goals",
