 It seems like you're asking for a Python program to complete the task of parsing subject-verb-object sentences and extracting the subject, verb, and object in each sentence. Here's an example code using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library:
```python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.tag import pos_tag

def parse_sentence(sentence):
    # Tokenize the sentence into words
    words = word_tokenize(sentence)
    
    # Tag each word with its part of speech (POS)
    tagged_words = pos_tag(words)
    
    # Extract the subject, verb, and object from the tagged words
    subject = ""
    verb = ""
    obj = ""
    for i in range(len(tagged_words)):
        if tagged_words[i][1].startswith("VB") or tagged_words[i][1].startswith("VBD"):  # Verb
            verb += " ".join(tagged_words[i:i+2])
        elif tagged_words[i][1] == "NN":  # Noun (subject or object)
            if subject == "":
                subject += " ".join(tagged_words[i:i+2])
                obj = ""
            else:
                obj += " ".join(tagged_words[i:i+2])
    
    return (subject, verb, obj)

# Example usage
sentences = [
    "Sam Johnson is eating breakfast.",
    "Joon Park is brewing coffee.",
    "Jane Cook is sleeping.",
    "Michael Bernstein is writing email on a computer.",
    "Percy Liang is teaching students in a classroom.",
    "Merrie Morris is running on a treadmill.",
    "Isabella Rodriguez is sleeping.",
]

for sentence in sentences:
    parsed_sentence = parse_sentence(sentence)
    print("Input:", sentence)
    print("Parsed:", parsed_sentence)
```
This program tokenizes each sentence into words, then uses part-of-speech (POS) tagging to identify verbs and nouns in the sentence. It then extracts the subject, verb, and object from the tagged words based on their POS tags. Finally, it prints out the input sentence along with its parsed subject, verb, and object.
