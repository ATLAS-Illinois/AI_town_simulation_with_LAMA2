Maria Lopez is currently preparing breakfast, and there is no information indicating that Klaus Mueller is in the same location as her.

To see GPT response~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First, we need to consider the context provided. Maria Lopez is preparing breakfast and Klaus Mueller is eating breakfast and drinking coffee. However, the text does not indicate that they are in the same location or that they can easily communicate with each other.

Additionally, there is no information about their relationship or previous interactions. It is also unclear whether Maria Lopez is aware that Klaus Mueller is currently having breakfast.
