The original hourly breakdown of Isabella's schedule for today, including the missing activity, is as follows:

* 5:00 PM: Host Valentine's Day party at Hobbs Cafe with customers
* 8:00 AM: Wake up and complete morning routine
* 9:00 AM: Prepare breakfast
* 10:00 AM: Check on employees and make sure they are doing well
* 10:30 AM: Prepare snacks and drinks for customers who want them
* 11:00 AM: Clean up after morning rush and make sure everything is back in order
* 12:00 PM: Have lunch with employees in the break room
* 1:00 PM: Close down cafe and make sure everything is ready for next day

To create an hourly schedule, we can divide Isabella's workday into 1-hour intervals, starting at 8am when she wakes up and completes her morning routine. We can then fill in the activities for each interval based on her daily plan, including preparation of breakfast, checking on employees, preparing snacks and drinks, cleaning up after the morning rush, having lunch with employees, closing down the cafe, etc.

One activity that is missing from Isabella's schedule is the activity scheduled for 5pm on February 14th, which is to host a Valentine's Day party at Hobbs Cafe with customers. We can add this activity to her schedule by filling in the 5pm time slot with "Host Valentine's Day party at Hobbs Cafe". This would give Isabella enough time to prepare for the party and make sure everything is ready for her customers

To create an hourly schedule, we can divide Isabella's workday into 1-hour intervals, starting at 8am when she wakes up and completes her morning routine. We can then fill in the activities for each interval based on her daily plan, including preparation of breakfast, checking on employees, preparing snacks and drinks, cleaning up after the morning rush, having lunch with employees, closing down the cafe, etc. One activity that was missing from her schedule is the activity scheduled for 5pm on February 14th, which is to host a Valentine's Day party at Hobbs Cafe with customers. We have added this activity to her schedule by filling in the 5pm time slot with "Host Valentine's Day party at Hobbs Cafe". This would give Isabella enough time to prepare for the party and make sure everything is ready for her customers.

I hope this clears up any confusion. Please let me know if you have any further questions

9:00 AM - Prepare breakfast
10:00 AM - Check on employees and make sure they are doing well
10:30 AM - Prepare snacks and drinks for customers who want them
11:00 AM - Clean up after the morning rush and make sure everything is back in order
12:00 PM - Have lunch with employees in the break room
1:00 PM - Close down cafe and make sure everything is ready for next day
5:00 PM - Host Valentine's Day party at Hobbs Cafe with customers (This activity was missing from the original schedule)

To create an hourly schedule, we can divide Isabella's workday into 1-hour intervals, starting at 8am when she wakes up and completes her morning routine. We can then fill in the activities for each interval based on her daily plan, including preparation of breakfast, checking on employees, preparing snacks and drinks, cleaning up after the morning rush, having lunch with employees, closing down the cafe, etc. One activity that was missing from her schedule is the activity scheduled for 5pm on February 14th, which is to host a Valentine's Day party at Hobbs Cafe with customers. We have added this activity to her schedule by filling in the 5pm time slot with "Host Valentine's Day party at Hobbs Cafe". This would give Isabella enough time to prepare for the party and make sure everything is ready for her customers

* 1:00 PM: Close down cafe and make sure everything is ready for next day

To create an hourly schedule, we can divide Isabella's workday into 1-hour intervals, starting at 8am when she wakes up and completes her morning routine. We can then fill in the activities for each interval based on her daily plan, including preparation of breakfast, checking on employees, preparing snacks and drinks, cleaning up after the morning rush, having lunch with employees, closing down the cafe, etc.

One activity that is missing from Isabella's schedule is the activity scheduled for 5pm on February 14th, which is to host a Valentine's Day party at Hobbs Cafe with customers. We can add this activity to her schedule by filling in the 5pm time slot with "Host Valentine's Day party at Hobbs Cafe". This would give Isabella enough time to prepare for the party and make sure everything is ready for her customers
