~~~ prompt    ----------------------------------------------------
This is a great start! It's important to have a detailed schedule for events and activities, as well as time intervals for rest, work, and leisure. To further enhance Isabella's schedule, you could also include specific tasks or responsibilities that she will be handling at each hour. For example:

* 8:00 AM - Wake up, have breakfast, and complete morning routine
* 9:00 AM - Arrive at Hobbs Cafe and begin preparing for the day (e.g., clean the space, set up tables, order inventory)
* 10:00 AM - Start serving customers and managing the cafe's operations
* 12:00 PM - Serve lunch menu and manage lunch service
* 1:00 PM - Take a short break for lunch or snack
* 2:00 PM - Serve afternoon snacks and drinks to customers
* 4:00 PM - Prepare for closing the cafe, clean up after dinner service, and restock supplies
* 6:00 PM - Close Hobbs Cafe for the day

By including specific tasks or responsibilities at each hour, you can provide a clearer understanding of Isabella's daily routine and give her a sense of structure and purpose. Additionally, it may be helpful to add in time blocks for any recurring tasks or responsibilities that she needs to complete regularly (e.g., inventory management, social media marketing)
