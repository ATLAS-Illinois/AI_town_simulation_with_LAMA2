~~~ prompt    ----------------------------------------------------
To provide a more accurate response, I will revise the hourly breakdown of Isabella's schedule for Monday, February 13th, 2023.

[(ID:sEW3Vb) Monday February 13 -- 05:00 PM] Activity: Isabella is To provide a more accurate response, I will revise the hourly breakdown of Isabella's schedule for Monday, February 13th, 2023.

Isabella's Valentine's Day party starts at 5pm and ends at 7pm. So, during those hours, she would be preparing and serving food to guests at Hobbs Cafe.

She would also need to prepare food for the party, which could take several hours.

Therefore, Isabella's schedule for Monday, February 13th, 2023 could look something like this:

[Monday February 13 -- 00:00 AM] Activity: Sleeping
[Monday February 13 -- 01:00 AM] Activity: Sleeping
