~~~ prompt    ----------------------------------------------------
I apologize, it appears that there was a mistake in the formatting of the hourly schedule. Based on the information provided, Isabella's daily plan requirement states that she opens Hobbs Cafe at 8am every day and works at the counter until 8pm, at which point she closes the cafe. However, the hourly schedule provided only includes activities from 10am to 7pm, with no mention of her morning routine or closing time.

Here is the corrected hourly schedule for Isabella's day:

Monday February 13
------------------
| Time            | Activity                                                          |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 8:00 AM         | Wake up and complete morning routine                                |
| 10:00 AM       | Arrive at Hobbs Cafe and begin preparing for the day                |
| 12:00 PM       | Open Hobbs Cafe and greet customers                                   |
| 4:00 PM        | Prepare for closing and finish cleaning up                         |
| 6:00 PM        | Close Hobbs Cafe and lock up                                      |
| 7:00 PM        | Go to bed                                                          |

Please note that the activities from 12pm to 4pm are missing, so it is unclear what Isabella will be doing during those hours. If you have more information about her daily schedule, please provide it and I will update the hourly schedule accordingly
