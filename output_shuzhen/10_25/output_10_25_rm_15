The information provided is inconsistent, and it appears that two different schedules have been given for Isabella. One schedule shows her activities from 7:00 am to 8:00 pm on Monday, February 13th, while the other schedule shows her activities from 9:00 am to 11:00 pm on Monday, February 13th. To provide a clear and accurate answer, I will assume that the second schedule is correct, showing Isabella's activities from 9:00 am to 11:00 pm.

According to the schedule, Isabella will wake up and complete her morning routine at 8:00 am, then open Hobbs Cafe at 9:00 am and start the day by making some coffee and greeting customers. From 10:00 am to 12:00 pm, Isabella will run the cafe during the morning hours, taking orders, serving customers, and making drinks. She will take a break from work to prepare lunch for herself and her family from 12:00 pm to 2:00 pm. From 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm, Isabella will clean and organize Hobbs Cafe for the afternoon shift. She will run the cafe during the afternoon hours from 4:00 pm to 6:00 pm, taking orders, serving customers, and making drinks.

According to the schedule, Isabella will wake up and complete her morning routine at 8:00 am, then open Hobbs Cafe at 9:00 am and start the day by making some coffee and greeting customers. From 10:00 am to 12:00 pm, Isabella will run the cafe during the morning hours, taking orders, serving customers, and making drinks. She will take a break from work to prepare lunch for herself and her family from 12:00 pm to 2:00 pm. From 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm, Isabella will clean and organize Hobbs Cafe for the afternoon shift. She will run the cafe during the afternoon hours from 4:00 pm to 6:00 pm, taking orders, serving customers, and making drinks.
