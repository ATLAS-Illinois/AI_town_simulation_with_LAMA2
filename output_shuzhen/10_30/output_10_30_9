She is currently gathering party material and telling everyone to join the party at Hobbs Cafe on that day and time.

Her daily plan requirement includes waking up at 6am and going to bed at 11pm. However, her schedule seems to be a little off as she doesn't have any activities planned for the first seven hours of the day. It is possible that she might have some other activities or errands to run in the morning before opening the cafe at 8am.

Isabella loves to make people feel welcome and comfortable, so it is likely that she will be busy during the party and ensuring that everything runs smoothly. She may also use the time between 8pm and 11pm to catch up on any administrative tasks or prepare for the next day
