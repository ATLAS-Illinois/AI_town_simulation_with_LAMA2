~~~ prompt    ----------------------------------------------------
It looks like there might be an error in the hourly breakdown of Isabella's schedule for today. The last entry at 7:00 PM on Sunday, February 12th, doesn't seem to match with any activities listed before or after that time. Additionally, the schedule ends abruptly at 7:00 PM instead of continuing until Monday morning as usual.

Without more information about what activities Isabella typically does during the evening, it's difficult to say for certain. However, she may have some leisure activities or errands that she does on Sunday evenings before closing Hobbs Cafe and going home. Alternatively, there might be a mistake in the schedule or data entry error.

It's also possible that you are looking at an outdated or incorrect schedule. In this case, I recommend checking with Isabella to confirm her schedule for today and making sure everything is accurate
